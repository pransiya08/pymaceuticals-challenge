This script analyses the effect of the anti-cancer drug regimens as compared to Capomulin, which is the company's drug of interest.
There are 249 mice involved in the study and the efficacy of the drug regimens is measured by their effect in the tumor volume of these mice after 45 days.
Included in this script is a clean up code to identify duplicated data, and several codes to produce statistical summary of the results, as well plots and charts for visualisation and analysis.
